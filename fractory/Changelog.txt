CHANGELOG

Beta 0.9.3 05.12.2016

Finalised the hotkeys, they are now saved and loaded, have safeguards against conflicts, properly show up in controls pane

Beta 0.9.3 04.12.2016

Rewrote the Controls pane properly, now uses the same code as the rest of the panes
Made all hotkeys rebindable!
They are not saved yet, however, and will revert to defaults on every page refresh

Beta 0.9.2 01.12.2016

Added the blank generator gem, keybinds to place it and talents for it!
Changed the method for buying maximum arcana upgrades at once to non-looped

Beta 0.9.1 01.12.2016

Made the maximum inventory size 3 columns by 7 rows, each point in 'bigger inventory' grants 3 slots, you start with 6
Reworked the code in keybindings to accomodate shift\ctr\alt modifiers for later
Hotkeys for buying crystals are now usable inside the inventory
Crystals can now be bought from the shop into your inventory by right clicking
Tooltips now shouldn't go offscreen and follow your mouse smoothly

Beta 0.9.1 28.11.2016

Added a button to show controls, most of this changelog is now there
Added the ability to scroll through simple crystal types and crystal tiers using mousewheel (both forward and backwards) - hover over the ">" button and scroll for types, hover over the tier plate for tiers
Fixed simple crystal types getting stuck
Fixed self-modifying crystals (power, lens, etc.)
Changed the styles in fractory.html to keep shop slots from bouncing around at high tiers (smaller font + wider slots)
Added the ability to quickly activate\deactivate links (hold shift\ctrl and move the mouse over them)
Holding shift when buying Enchanting upgrades now buys as many as you can in one click
Added hotkeys to place all gem types, 1-0 for the first 10, shift + 1-0 for the rest

Added hotkeys:
q: quickbuy - buys a crystal from current simple shop slot and places it, if possible
d: delete - deletes a crystal from a node
r: quick relay - places a relay, if possible
c: quick conduit - places a conduit, if possible
f: quick fractal - places a correct (lowest suitable) tier of fractal, if possible (so it will place a T1 if you're on the main layer, a T2 if you're in a T1 fractal and so on)
