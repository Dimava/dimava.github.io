# Shapes

Quads do not have to be quarters - you can also split full circle into three or six quads

No matter the quad count, they are always clearly recognizeable


# Colors

Colors come in batches of 3
Merging colors is done by painters, and it does not mix colors, only batches.

Single painter uses 1 batch to paint 1 shape, and outputs leftower paint to the right.
Double painter uses 3 batches to paint 2 shapes, and thus can be used to paint with mixed colors.

Mixed colors are: rgb=white, rrg=orange, rgg=yellow,
ggb=grass, gbb=cyan, bbr=purple, brr=pink


# Buildings

There is only a single balancer - 1x1 2-to-2. And it's always enough.

Single painters have secondary output for outputting unused paint
Single painters may mix paint, outputting unused paint to the secondary output

Rotators can rotate shapes by +- 1/4 and +- 1/3, alowing for 12 rotations.

Cutters always cut a vertical line, cutting quads into smaller quads as needed
